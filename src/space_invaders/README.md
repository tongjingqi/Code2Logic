# Space Invaders Dataset Generator

This project generates a visual question answering (VQA) dataset based on the classic game Space Invaders. The dataset consists of various game states and corresponding questions that test both perception and strategic reasoning abilities.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```bash
cd space_invaders
```

Generate the dataset using main.py:

```bash
python main.py --num-qa NUM_QA [--scene-level-dist EASY MED HARD] [--output-dir DIR] [--cover-exist]
```

Arguments:
- `--num-qa`: Number of QA pairs to generate (required)
- `--scene-level-dist`: Distribution ratios of Easy:Medium:Hard difficulty levels (default: 5 3 2)
- `--output-dir`: Output directory path (default: 'space_invaders_dataset')
- `--cover-exist`: Whether to overwrite existing output directory

Example:
```bash
python main.py --num-qa 900 --scene-level-dist 5 3 2 --output-dir space_invaders_dataset
```

This will generate:
- `images/`: PNG files of game scenes
- `states/`: JSON files containing game state information
- `fill_dataset.json`: Questions requiring numeric answers
- `mcq_dataset.json`: Multiple-choice questions
- `data.json`: Combined dataset

## Game Description

### Basic Rules
- A ship at the bottom can move horizontally and shoot lasers upward
- Enemies are initially arranged in a matrix formation (enemy_rows Ã— enemy_cols)
- Enemies move uniformly either left or right
- Different enemies have different point values when destroyed:
  - Purple enemies: 30 points
  - Blue enemies: 20 points
  - Green enemies: 10 points

### Simplified Game Interface
- The enemy area is divided into a grid with numbered rows and columns
- Each cell is either empty or contains an enemy (purple, blue, or green)
- The ship is aligned with a column at the bottom
- When shooting, only the lowermost enemy in the same column can be destroyed

### Time Sequence Rules
- Time is discretized into intervals (t, t+1, t+2, ...)
- During each interval t:
  1. The ship can move to any column
  2. The ship can shoot at most once
  3. Enemies remain stationary
- At the end of each interval, enemies move one step in their current direction

## Question Types

### State Information
1. Count enemies in a specific row/column
2. Count total number of enemies
3. Count enemies of a specific color
4. Calculate points from shooting at current position

### Action Outcomes
1. Calculate points from moving to a specific column and shooting
2. Calculate total points from continuous shooting while enemies move

### Strategy Optimization
1. Find maximum points possible from one shot
2. Find maximum points possible from two shots
