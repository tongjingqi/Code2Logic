        "question": "\nSpider Solitaire\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nSpider is played with eight decks of 13 spade cards each, totaling 104 unique cards. The goal is to arrange all cards in a King-to-Ace sequence in the same suit and move them to the foundation piles. Once all sequences are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\n\n# SETUP\nThe game features waste piles, a stock pile, and foundation piles. Waste piles are where the action happens, and the stock pile provides new cards when necessary.\n\n**Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0`. The cards within each waste pile are also numbered starting from the bottom card.\n\n# GAME BOARD COMPONENTS\n\n## **Stock Pile**\nThe **Stock Pile** holds all remaining cards and is used to deal new cards into the waste piles. \nStock Pile is in the top left corner of the board.\n\n- **Staggered Card Stacking**: Cards are stacked in layers, and the number of layers indicates how many more times you can deal cards to the waste piles. Each deal moves one card face-up to each waste pile.\n\n## **Waste Piles**\nThe **Waste Piles** are where cards are played and organized.\nWaste Piles are on the bottom of the chessboard\n\n- **Face-Up vs. Face-Down Cards**: Cards are stacked with face-up cards visible and face-down cards hidden. Only face-up cards can be played. When a face-down card becomes the top card of a pile, it is turned face-up and can be played.\n\n- **Staggered Cards**: Cards in each waste pile are arranged so that face-up cards are on top, and face-down cards are beneath. As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** How many times can the stockpile still deal cards?",
        "answer": "3",
        "analysis": "We can see that the stockpile has 3 stacks of overlapping cards. By counting the number of overlapping cards in the stockpile, we know that the stockpile can now be dealt 3 times"

The goal is to arrange all cards in a King-to-Ace sequence in the same suit and move them to the foundation piles. Once all sequences are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\n\n# SETUP\nThe game features waste piles, a stock pile, and foundation piles. Waste piles are where the action happens, and the stock pile provides new cards when necessary.\n\n**Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0`. The cards within each waste pile are also numbered starting from the bottom card.\n\n# GAME BOARD COMPONENTS\n\n## **Stock Pile**\nThe **Stock Pile** holds all remaining cards and is used to deal new cards into the waste piles. \nStock Pile is in the top left corner of the board.\n\n- **Staggered Card Stacking**: Cards are stacked in layers, and the number of layers indicates how many more times you can deal cards to the waste piles. Each deal moves one card face-up to each waste pile.\n\n## **Waste Piles**\nThe **Waste Piles** are where cards are played and organized.\nWaste Piles are on the bottom of the chessboard\n\n- **Face-Up vs. Face-Down Cards**: Cards are stacked with face-up cards visible and face-down cards hidden. Only face-up cards can be played. When a face-down card becomes the top card of a pile, it is turned face-up and can be played.\n\n- **Staggered Cards**: Cards in each waste pile are arranged so that face-up cards are on top, and face-down cards are beneath. As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** What will happen if I want to move the number 3 card of pile 1 to pile 3?\n\n**Options:**\nA. The move will be successful, and the cards will be in descending order, following the rules of movement.\nB. The move cannot be made because this card is face-down and its value is unknown.\nC. The move cannot be made because there is a card above it, and that card does not form a descending order with the selected card.\nD. The move cannot be made because the top card of the target pile does not have a rank equal to this card's rank plus one.\nE. The move cannot be made because the pile has too few cards, and this card does not exist.",

As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** Based on the current board state, what is the optimal strategy we should adopt?\n\n**Options:**\nA. We should move the 9-th card of pile 1 to pile 6.\nB. We should move the 2-th card of pile 0 to pile 1.\nC. We should move the 2-th card of pile 5 to pile 1.\nD. We should move the 2-th card of pile 6 to pile 2.\nE. We should move the 4-th card of pile 5 to pile 7.\nF. We should move the 2-th card of pile 2 to pile 1.\nG. No cards can be moved; we should click the stockpile to deal cards.\nH. We should move cards from pile 0 to the foundation piles.",
        "answer": "A",
        "analysis": "The optimal strategy is to form a descending sequence of the same suit to maximize potential moves.

As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** What will happen if I want to move the number 8 card of pile 8 to pile 3?\n\n**Options:**\nA. The move will be successful, and the cards will be in descending order, following the rules of movement.\nB. The move cannot be made because this card is face-down and its value is unknown.\nC. The move cannot be made because there is a card above it, and that card does not form a descending order with the selected card.\nD.

The goal is to arrange all cards in a King-to-Ace sequence in the same suit and move them to the foundation piles. Once all sequences are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\n\n# SETUP\nThe game features waste piles, a stock pile, and foundation piles. Waste piles are where the action happens, and the stock pile provides new cards when necessary.\n\n**Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0`. The cards within each waste pile are also numbered starting from the bottom card.\n\n# GAME BOARD COMPONENTS\n\n## **Stock Pile**\nThe **Stock Pile** holds all remaining cards and is used to deal new cards into the waste piles. \nStock Pile is in the top left corner of the board.\n\n- **Staggered Card Stacking**: Cards are stacked in layers, and the number of layers indicates how many more times you can deal cards to the waste piles. Each deal moves one card face-up to each waste pile.\n\n## **Waste Piles**\nThe **Waste Piles** are where cards are played and organized.\nWaste Piles are on the bottom of the chessboard\n\n- **Face-Up vs. Face-Down Cards**: Cards are stacked with face-up cards visible and face-down cards hidden. Only face-up cards can be played. When a face-down card becomes the top card of a pile, it is turned face-up and can be played.\n\n- **Staggered Cards**: Cards in each waste pile are arranged so that face-up cards are on top, and face-down cards are beneath. As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved.

We should move the 5-th card of pile 7 to pile 3.\nB. We should move the 2-th card of pile 4 to pile 3.\nC. We should move the 8-th card of pile 2 to pile 4.\nD. We should move the 5-th card of pile 6 to pile 2.\nE. We should move the 3-th card of pile 1 to pile 2.\nF. We should move the 3-th card of pile 0 to pile 0.\nG.

As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** If I click the stockpile for 4 times, how many face-up cards will be in waste pile 3?",
        "answer": "6",
        "analysis": "Dealing 4 time(s) would add 2 face-up card(s) to waste pile 3. Currently, there are 4 face-up card(s) in this pile. Therefore, after clicking the stock pile, there would be 6 face-up card(s) in waste pile 3."

        "question": "\nSpider Solitaire\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nSpider is played with eight decks of 13 spade cards each, totaling 104 unique cards. The goal is to arrange all cards in a King-to-Ace sequence in the same suit and move them to the foundation piles. Once all sequences are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\n\n# SETUP\nThe game features waste piles, a stock pile, and foundation piles. Waste piles are where the action happens, and the stock pile provides new cards when necessary.\n\n**Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0`. The cards within each waste pile are also numbered starting from the bottom card.\n\n# GAME BOARD COMPONENTS\n\n## **Stock Pile**\nThe **Stock Pile** holds all remaining cards and is used to deal new cards into the waste piles. \nStock Pile is in the top left corner of the board.\n\n- **Staggered Card Stacking**: Cards are stacked in layers, and the number of layers indicates how many more times you can deal cards to the waste piles. Each deal moves one card face-up to each waste pile.\n\n## **Waste Piles**\nThe **Waste Piles** are where cards are played and organized.\nWaste Piles are on the bottom of the chessboard\n\n- **Face-Up vs. Face-Down Cards**: Cards are stacked with face-up cards visible and face-down cards hidden. Only face-up cards can be played. When a face-down card becomes the top card of a pile, it is turned face-up and can be played.\n\n- **Staggered Cards**: Cards in each waste pile are arranged so that face-up cards are on top, and face-down cards are beneath. As you move cards, new face-down cards are revealed.\n\n- **Card Numbering and Screen Position**: \n  - **Waste Pile Numbering**: Piles are numbered from left to right starting with `0` for the leftmost pile. \n  - The card at the bottom of each waste pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0** and is the **topmost visible card** in the pile.\n  - As you move upward in the pile, the next cards are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, and so on.\n  - Visually, the bottom card (number **0**) is the one closest to the top of the screen, and the cards above it are stacked above in the pile, going downwards.\n\n## **Foundation Pile**\nFoundation pile stores all the arranged suit. When a suit is arranged in sequence, it may be removed to a foundation pile. If all suits are moved to the foundations, the game is won.\nFoundation Pile is in the top right corner of the board.\n\n# MOVING CARDS\n- **Movement Conditions**: \n  - **Move a single card**: The single card being moved must be placed on a top card that is of the **same suit** and has a **higher rank** (e.g., a Q can be placed on a K). \n  - **Move multiple cards**: A complete **descending sequence** of cards (such as K, Q, J, 10, etc.) can be moved from one pile to another. When moving a descending sequence of cards to another pile, the new sequence must be a **same-suit sequence** and follow the **descending order** from K, Q, J, 10, 9, ..., 2, A.\n- **Face-Down Cards**: If the sequence you are moving includes face-down cards, they will be flipped face-up once they are moved. After flipping, the newly face-up cards can continue to be moved or interacted with.\n- **Example**: If you have a sequence of K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in the same suit, you can move a card 6 that has the same suit to the top of this pile, resulting in a new sequence K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6.\n- **Empty Pile Rule**: An empty waste pile can accept any card. After placing the card, you can continue adding a descending same-suit sequence to that pile.\n- **Reveal Cards**: If a move leaves a face-down card on top, it will be turned face-up.\n\n# DEALING\nClick the stock to deal a new row of face-up cards to the waste piles. You may not deal if there is an empty waste pile.\n\n# STRATEGY\n- Turn face-down cards face-up.\n- Form runs of the same suit in descending order.\n- Use empty waste piles strategically.\n\n# VARIANTS\nIn **circular spider solitaire**, a King can be placed on an Ace, allowing for extended sequences.\n\n# **NOTE: Important Numbering Reminder**\n- **Waste Pile Numbering**: Waste piles are numbered from **left to right** starting with `0` for the leftmost pile.\n- **Card Numbering within Waste Piles**: The **bottom-most card** of each pile (usually face-down) is numbered **0**, and the cards above it are numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, etc., moving upwards in the pile.\n- **Please Pay Attention** to both the waste pile and card numbering methods, as they will help you navigate and make strategic decisions effectively.\n\n\n**Question:** What should I do if I want to reveal the first face-down card in waste pile 5?\n\n**Options:**\nA. No action is needed; there are no face-down cards in this pile.\nB. There is no immediate way to reveal it; we should move cards from other piles first and wait for more information.\nC. We should move the 3-th card of pile 7 to pile 1.\nD. We should move the card of pile 5 to pile 0.\nE. We should move the 7-th card of pile 0 to pile 7.\nF. We should move the 9-th card of pile 8 to pile 4.\nG. We should move the 0-th card of pile 0 to pile 6.\nH. We should move the 7-th card of pile 9 to pile 2.",
