Click blocks are yellow, occupy 1 cell, and you can get 10 points by clicking them. \n2. Reverse blocks are green, occupy 1 cell, and you can get 15 points by clicking them. It should be noted that after you click the Reverse block, the entire game situation will **reverse left and right**, but your finger position **will not** change accordingly. \n3. A Snake block occupies 2 or more consecutive cells in a column, and its first cell (called Snake Head block) is pink, its last cell (called Snake Tail block) is grey, and the middle cells (called Snake Body blocks, if any) are blue. Only when you click on **all cells** occupied by the snake block can you score points. The score is related to the length $l$ (including the head and tail) of the snake block.
