# 3D Maze Puzzle Generator

This project contains a 3D maze puzzle generator written in Python. The generator creates puzzles with various types of questions, including path-finding, sequence-finding, height comparison, and main path identification.

## Features

- **Path-Finding Puzzles**: Generate puzzles where the player must find the correct path from start to goal.
- **Sequence-Finding Puzzles**: Generate puzzles where the player must identify the correct sequence of checkpoints.
- **Height Comparison Puzzles**: Generate puzzles where the player must compare the heights of different points.
- **Main Path Identification Puzzles**: Generate puzzles where the player must identify which numbered blocks are on the main path.

## Usage

To generate a dataset of puzzles, run the following command:

```bash
python generate_mixed_dataset.py
```

This will create a dataset with mixed problem types and save the images and states in the specified output directory.

You can easily change the number of questions generated by modifying last part in main.py:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    outputPath = "3d_maze_dataset_example"
    generate_mixed_dataset(15)
```

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
- `dataclasses`
- `typing`
- `random`
