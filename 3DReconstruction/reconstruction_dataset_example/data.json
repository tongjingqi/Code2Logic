Finding Required Positions:\n   By matching candidates from both projections:\n   - When (?, y, z) from Y-Z view matches (x, ?, z) from X-Z view, position (x, y, z) can be filled.\n   - Example: if we have (?, 2, 3) and (1, ?, 3), then (1, 2, 3) is required\n   - To ensure connectivity, we can add voxels at positions where projections already show 1\n     * This strategy is optimal because it doesn't create new projections\n     * Use these positions as 'bridges' to connect required positions\n   Required positions from projection matching: [(1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 2)]\n\n5. Connectivity Analysis and Completion:\n   a) Checking connectivity of required positions:\n      - Required positions must connect to existing structure\n      - Required positions must connect to each other\n   b) Adding connecting voxels if needed:\n      - Additional voxels must not violate projection constraints\n      - Prioritize positions that satisfy multiple connectivity needs\n   c) Final set of positions to add: [(1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 2)]\n\n6. Verifying Optimality:\n   After adding 3 voxels:\n   - Projection verification:\n     * Y-Z projection matches:\n       [0, 0, 0] (top)\n       [0, 1, 0] (middle)\n       [0, 1, 0] (bottom)\n     * X-Z projection matches:\n       [0, 0, 0] (top)\n       [0, 0, 1] (middle)\n       [1, 1, 1] (bottom)\n   - Connectivity verification: All voxels are face-connected\n   - Minimality verification:\n     * All required positions are included\n     * Minimum number of connecting voxels added\n     * Cannot satisfy all constraints with fewer voxels\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of voxels needed to complete the reconstruction is 3."
