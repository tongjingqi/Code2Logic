Cards in cascade piles must be stacked in descending order with alternating colors\n2. Only one card can be moved at a time (unless using free cells)\n3. Foundation piles must be built up by suit from Ace to King\n4. Free cells can hold only one card each\n\nWhich of the following moves is valid in the current game state?the options are as follows:\n1.Move (Diamond,4) from FreeCell 0 to Foundation Heart\n2.Move (Heart,8) from FreeCell 2 to Foundation Diamond\n3.Move (Heart,9) from Cascade 5 to Cascade 0\n4.Move (Heart,8) from FreeCell 1 to Cascade 3\n",
